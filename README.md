# neuronet
 my realization of perceptron neuronet (tested only on iris dataset)
 at last commit i combined class Neuron with Neurocolumn. it was reduced  a learning rate for more stable convergence of results. 
 now it learning but not use his knowledge for something. only show value of error. =). 
 next task is to make some applying of this neuronet. now it is fully useless.
